Onsite parking that you will become a pro at manuevering in and out of.  Will also gave great tips on backing into the spot.&lt;br/&gt;3)\\tI fully enjoyed the patio space for my meals, reading, working on my laptop, and enjoying nature along with sunsets.&lt;br/&gt;4)\\tThe space will also really discipline you to buy just enough grocery for the week and eat everything up. It really feeds into my minimalist side. Costco shopping might not work unless you find friends/colleagues to split portions up.&lt;br/&gt;5)\\tThe space has three windows and bring a comfortable breeze and plenty of sunshine into the cabin.&lt;br/&gt;6)\\tWill keeps the cabin really clean and supplies everything that you need. If you ever have a question, he is quick to respond. One time, I needed pliers for fixing something of mine, and the next day it appeared in front of the cabin &lt;br/&gt;7)\\tWill provides you with an amazing snack basket upon arrival and it will last you for a week a good long time. &lt;br/&gt;8)\\tThroughout my stay, Will offered additional fresh fruits and snacks.</td>\n",

The space is very quaint which fit 2 guests perfectly. There were a few things that could be improved (shower head leaking water to the outside of the bathroom) and some ants but overall it was still bearable and more just nuisances. I would still recommend this place as Silver Lake is a cute neighborhood!   \n",

Quiet, comfortable, well laid out, with everything I needed for a great weeklong stay. Great view out the main window. And there was even a beautiful bouquet of flowers on the table when I arrived, and he had thoughtfully brought in extra heaters and blanket, since there was cold weather in the forecast. Also really appreciated being able to bring my dog. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you!   \n",

Everything was great to the home and location.  The home can get chilly at times the space heater helps and opening the blinds to allow sun worked to keep warm.

       "4066  What a lovely month that I had staying in this hillside cabin. True to all the reviews left prior for Will and to the space-I am glad that I also got the same opportunity to be a part of this wonderful experience.<br/>1)\\tThis spot was perfect for one person. <br/>2)\\tAll my basic needs were met. Onsite parking that you will become a pro at manuevering in and out of.  Will also gave great tips on backing into the spot.<br/>3)\\tI fully enjoyed the patio space for my meals, reading, working on my laptop, and enjoying nature along with sunsets.<br/>4)\\tThe space will also really discipline you to buy just enough grocery for the week and eat everything up. It really feeds into my minimalist side. Costco shopping might not work unless you find friends/colleagues to split portions up.<br/>5)\\tThe space has three windows and bring a comfortable breeze and plenty of sunshine into the cabin.<br/>6)\\tWill keeps the cabin really clean and supplies everything that you need. If you ever have a question, he is quick to respond. One time, I needed pliers for fixing something of mine, and the next day it appeared in front of the cabin <br/>7)\\tWill provides you with an amazing snack basket upon arrival and it will last you for a week a good long time. <br/>8)\\tThroughout my stay, Will offered additional fresh fruits and snacks.   \n",

Helanie and her family made us feel immediately comfortable and welcomed when we arrived, and so throughout our whole stay. The room is spacious, the bed divine and the bathroom two steps from the room. Also the fan saved us at night as it can get warm in that area. A lovely breakfast awaited us in the morning, really appreciated it! I was given a list of things to do and see in LA by Helanie's daughter which I am really grateful for. All in all I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, as I doubt you could come across a sweeter and more cheerful family!    \n",

The location was great for where we wanted to go. We had some issues with the wifi. We were told there was a washer which was not the case but there was a laundry mat across the street that was very nice that we ended up using. Parking was easy to find and and we really enjoyed the taco shop nearby.   \n",

Very clean. Very well stocked. But noisy street. Better suited for two people who can share the bedroom that is away from the windows. Convenience store and CVS just steps away. Fantastic restaurants/bar just next to the building.   \n",

It was clean, comfortable and had all the amenities we could have hoped for. I really couldn't have asked for more in terms of the home - and its proximity to the beach, shops, etc. made it easy to get around (although we did just stay at the house for most evenings!)\\r<br/>\\r<br/>In addition, Ray was very responsive and had everything set up so that we really felt at home for a long weekend. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, especially with Ray as the host!    \n",

Unfortunately Mike was out of town and we didn't get to meet him in person, but he made satisfactory arrangements for our arrival and departure.  The hideaway is small, but the bed is comfortable, nice linens, TV, bathroom adequate and the kitchenette well-stocked. A toaster would have been a welcome addition to the \"kitchen\". This is a converted closet-kitchen, very compact and no sink for dish clean-up (except outside or in bathroom). The apartment was clean and the neighborhood quiet. We felt safe walking at night.   \n",

It was great to have so many bathrooms so everyone had space to get ready. Neighbors were a bit loud one of the nights, but was possibly just an anomaly. Overall it had everything we needed and was located centrally so getting food delivered was no problem. Hosts were responsive and friendly!   \n",

Super clean and in a great neighborhood with zero hassle parking. I forgot to pack toiletries but Ara had travel sized shampoo & conditioner that saved the day. Highly recommend staying here if you’re looking for a quality air bnb!   \n",

We loved our stay, the apartment was terrific and our host was very friendly and welcoming. The location was absolutely ideal for walking to the beach and Main St. We borrowed the 2 bikes to head to Manhattan Beach--what a lovely bike ride. We definitely hope to return to Santa Monica and would love to stay here when we do. Thanks again!   \n",

Kerri was very kind and very easy to reach. Important to note that there are other guests in multiple rooms, so the place is set up like a bed and breakfast. Backyard is huge and everything (restaurants, gas stations theatres, etc) is only a few blocks down.   \n",

It was spotless when we arrived, and throughout our stay there were super communicative and quick to respond to any questions we had. It's been properly set up as a home, rather than temporary accommodation so there's literally everything you could possibly need (sharp knives included). They're also really lovely people! 10/10 would recommend.   \n",

Met us for check in and let us get settled in immediately.  We were exhausted after a local 5K so that was much appreciated.  We were there for such a short time that we didn't use the wifi, but I would have appreciated a printout or something in the room. Not a big deal. He has two amazing dogs who are so friendly! I wish we had had more time spend there and hangout.  We left the wrong keys upon leaving and he helped coordinate an exchange the next day.  He had local recommendations as well which were appreciated!   \n",

Since I mentioned that we had 4 people, they even made all beds (sofa bed and the extra mattress) for us beforehand. Mick and Misty are very friendly and responding to our questions very quickly. The place is also super clean and well decorated. Definitely recommended!   \n",

To be honest, we would have stayed another 2 weeks if we could have! The touches in this space were the best of any Airbnb we have stayed in at this price point. I love a soft comfy bed and pillows that your head just sinks into and that was exactly what they had here. My wife and I were here doing some business planning and just needed a space that we could work from and it was well provided. The couch, the dinner table, and the outdoor patio were great! You also can't beat only being about 3 blocks from the beach and boardwalk. This family has multiple other listings so if this one isn't available I would highly recommend one of their other properties. If they put as much care and thought into one I would imagine they spread that same care to their other listings.<br/><br/>Thank you again for a wonderful stay!   \n",

The only thing I would say was a bit strange was that their home was on the property. For the most part our visit was pretty private but we did walk in on a birthday party which was awkward. But overall it was a nice home and they were there to accommodate and help us on our visit   \n",

What a great place to stay within walking distance of so much in Pasadena.  <br/><br/>Modern and clean!  The kitchen appliances were so amazing that we decided to stay in and cook one night instead of going to the great restaurants close by.  Traders Joes is just a block away.<br/><br/>Very quiet.  Very secure feeling.  Indoor gated garage.  Great host.  We will definitely stay here for future trips to Pasadena.   \n",

We locked ourselves out and the host responded in 10 minutes to get us back in. Great service. The beds were very comfortable and there was enough parking for 3 cars in the driveway. We had a wonderful time and look forward to visiting this little beauty again soon.   \n",

Erg prettig dat je de auto op het eigen terrein kan parkeren, een auto is een must om te hebben als je LA wil bezichtigen waar alles ver van elkaar vandaag ligt. We hebben een hier een heerlijke tijd gehad en zullen in de toekomst zeker weer voor Tropical oasis kiezen.   \n",

Perfeito para duas pessoas terem uma estadia confortável.  A vizinhança não é muito barulhenta e a localização e muito boa, principalmente se você pretende visitar venice, Santa monica  e downtown. Os hosts são muito atenciosos. Definitivamente me hospedaria novamente!   \n",

Only one of the two bathrooms can take a bath, and the other has no bathing facilities.

Check-in information was accurate and not difficult. The bedding is good and the interior is tidy. There are 2 bathrooms, so I put them to good use. There were also plenty of towels. I also used wifi without any problems. It's different from the location shown on Airbnb before booking, but I received the correct address right after booking. Close to Grove Mall and Whole Foods Market. It's on the main road, so I used it without worrying about security!  \n",

A large bedroom, separate dining room / kitchen, very clean and a beautiful garden with swimming pool and jacuzzi. Kristy and Hendrik are very hospitable and nice. Very nice that you can park the car on your own property, a car is a must if you want to visit LA where everything is far apart today. We had a wonderful time here and will definitely choose Tropical oasis again in the future.  \n",

But it must be clear that a car is needed, like everywhere in LA. From the apartment you can reach all tourist attractions within 30 minutes (no traffic jams). The communication was very rudimentary but was sufficient. I can only recommend the clean apartment.  \n",

The neighborhood was very pleasant and quiet, but still very close to Venice Beach (about a 20-minute walk) and therefore centrally located. The room was very nice and comfortably furnished, everything was very clean and well thought out. Valerie is a very open and warm hostess, we felt very comfortable. We can fully recommend Valerie's accommodation.  \n",

       "9120  The perfect Los Angeles lodging choice! The location is super good, the parking is convenient, the brother and sister run the big house left by the family, it is a perfect home! The facilities are complete, the breakfast is rich, and the yard with the swimming pool is cozy and beautiful. Although they live together, they are completely independent without affecting their daily life, and they can also chat with friends from all over the world. The host is friendly and suggested several restaurants and bars to me, all of which are great choices! I'm still back in Los Angeles and choose here! Will definitely recommend to friends too. The trip is over, but I especially miss the time I lived in LA. I wish you happiness!  \n",
